# OpenURL Example 2
#
# ==
#
# How about amazon.com using an OpenURL to allow Jon Doe
# to put the following book into his Amazon shopping cart:
#
# Professional XML Meta Data. 2001. ISBN 1861004516.
#   by David Dodds, Andrew Watt, Mark Birbeck, Jay Cousins,
#   Kal Ahmed, Daniel Rivers-Moore, Joshua Lubell, Miloslav
#   Nic, Danny Ayers, Ann Wrightson.
# <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861004516>
#
# In this case, the Referent is clearly the XML book,
# amazon.com is the Referrer, and Joe Doe the Requester.
# The Referring-Entity could be considered to be the page
# <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1861004516>, and
# the Service-Type is "add to my cart". The Resolver is the
# web-service operated by Amazon that accepts - amongst
# others - requests to add materials to a shopping cart.
