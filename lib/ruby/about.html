<p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
This OpenURL resolver parses, validates and services an OpenURL.
<p>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
OpenURL parameters are read in batch mode from a querystring or data post.
In user mode parameters are read from the web form. Remote parameters can
be fetched over the network
from a property list using a <b>context-pointer</b>.
<p>
<h3>Validation</h3>
The validation process includes checks on the <b>administration</b> version,
the presence of a <b>referent</b> entity descriptor, legal <b>identifier</b> namespace
 IDs and schemes, and legal <b>metadata</b> format identifiers and keywords. A
more complete summary of checks is listed under <a href="features.html"><b>features</b></a>.
<p>
<h3>Services</h3>
The default service of this resolver is to render this OpenURL as a property list. Other
renditions (Excel, Querystring, RDF, XML) can also be selected.
<p>
Further services are available through the use of service directives
which are implemented by using <b>identifiers</b> of <b>service-type</b>.
Examples include: (no)strict, (no)validate, (no)refs, trace, forward (to another service component). 
See <a href="directives.html"><b>directives</b></a> for a fuller listing.
