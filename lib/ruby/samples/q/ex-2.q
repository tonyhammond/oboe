# OpenURL Sample 2
#
# ==
#
# This is Example 4 but without the private data section. A forward
# service directive is supplied, and a resolver - DOI Agent - is
# identified. DOI Agent is an OpenURL service that retrieves any DOI
# identifiers within the context-object and resolves those DOIs to
# managed resources which it then adds in to the context to enrich it.
