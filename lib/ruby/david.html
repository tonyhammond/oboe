<h1>Linking &amp; Structures</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Main focus of this activity is on the open description technologies which are 
paving the way to the dawn of the semantic web, and especially on the two big guns in the publishing industry's arsenal: DOI and OpenURL. This activity
is also engaged with
CrossRef and presently working with them on a parameter passing demo and
about to start a DOI prototype for extended services.
<p>
The recurring motifs below are frameworks, services and multiples.
<p>
<h3>DOI</h3>
With DOI we have a public identifier and are chiefly concerned with the
 disclosure of information. Currently DOI is resolved to a single resolution
 target. For ES this is the I-Hub which can dispatch 
to any platform that it has holdings info for. But DOI has a much 
greater promise: multiple resolution. 
DOI uses Handle as its resolution 
technology which provides a secure name resolution service for the Internet 
and resolves a given Handle to mutiple items
of typed data. 
<p>
So, in effect one DOI can have multiple targets and multiple application profiles.
Question is: How do we properly harness this power for DOI? Cue YADS.
<p>
<h3>YADS - A Description Service</h3>
This is a recursive data model elaborated over the past 18 months for 
describing resource collections. See:<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1014/yads">http://hdl.handle.net/1014/yads</a>
<p>
The model is a simple RDF profile (with 2 classes and 7 properties) and aims to be safe and
predictable to implement. It is already entrenched in the new CrossRef schema
for the data payload section. One notable feature of this model is the late binding
of types, or semantic indirection. This means that a YADS description
can carry many other descriptions: CrossRef, OpenURL, XLink, etc.
A YADS description is not just a packaging mechanism but can be bootstrapped
into a services environment. Any resource hierarchy can be blessed into an
application profile class to 
give an instance of an application profile: schema + services + data.
<p>
<h3>OpenURL</h3>
Currently NISO Committee AX is working towards a standardization of the OpenURL. Unlike the existing deployed version (v.0.1) which is hardwired for dealing with basic scholarly publishing genres, the new standard-to-be (v.1.0) provides a totally generic framework for building contextual links.
An OpenURL results when a context-object is sent to a resolver. A context-object
is a basket of (up to) 6 entities which are described by (up to) 4 descriptor
types which can occur multiply. 
The table below lists the entity/descriptor matrix.

<p>
Resource identifiers belong to 3 different
namespaces: uniform (URI), OpenURL, or foreign.
<p>
<h3>Oboe</h3>
To kickstart the general adoption of OpenURL an open source set of libraries
is proposed: Oboe - OpenURL Based Open Environment. An early binding has
been made for the language Ruby facilitating the development of tools. For
an instance of a validating resolver for OpenURL see:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1014/oboe">http://hdl.handle.net/1014/oboe</a>
<p>
Other bindings to Java, Perl and Python should be possible. (Some of the code
base is already ported to Java and Perl.) Each language would make use of
a common registry implemented as a regular properties file.
