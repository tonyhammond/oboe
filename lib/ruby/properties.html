<hr>
<p>
An OpenURL property list is just a user-friendly
means of describing name/value pairs. The main  points about this format are:
<ul>
<li>Each property (or name/value pair) is written out on a separate line.
<p>
<li>The property name (aka key) is the first 
complete word at the beginning of the line with possible leading
whitespace (space or tab characters).
<p>
<li>The name may be followed by an
optional
delimiter character (either "=" or ":") to separate it from the value
and there may be
optional leading and trailing whitespace around the delimiter.
<p>
<li>The first
 non-whitespace character following either the whitespace or delimiter character introduces the property's value which extends until the
last non-whitespace character on the line and includes any whitespace
characters contained within.
<p>
<li>Empty lines or lines containing only whitespace are ignored, as are any
lines beginning with a comment character "#".
<p>
<li>Line endings may be escaped by preceding the line ending with the
escape character "\" which allows a long property value to be entered over
several lines. Leading whitespace on continued lines is disregarded.
</ul>
<p>
Some examples follow:
<p>
<pre>
# A referent identifier

   ref_id= uri:http://www.sciencedirect.com

# A referent metadata format value

title   The title of the paper is too long to fit on one line \
      so we escape the line ending

# A service identifier (aka a service directive)

 srv_id  : _ri:oboe:to_rdf
</pre>
