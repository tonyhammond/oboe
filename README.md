# Oboe - OpenURL Based Open Environment

Oboe - or, OpenURL Based Open Environment - aimed to deliver an open source set of libraries for [OpenURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenURL).
An early binding was made for Ruby which allowed the development of some tools.

Other bindings to Java, Perl and Python should be possible. (Some of the code base is already ported to Java and Perl.)
Each language would make use of a common registry implemented as a regular properties file.
